# exam-solver

**exam-solver** is a backend-oriented microservices project designed to automate the **correction and solving of academic exams**. It simulates a production-grade distributed system and showcases real-world AI integrations using **Java 17**, **Spring Boot**, **RabbitMQ**, **OpenAI GPT-4 (Text & Vision)**, and **Nougat OCR** for scientific documents.

This project is part of my personal portfolio, aiming to demonstrate my expertise in scalable backend architectures, intelligent document processing, and modern microservice design.

## üîß Features

- Accepts exam submissions as **PDF files**, **scanned documents**, or **photos**
- Hybrid document processing pipeline:
  - PDFs parsed via **Apache PDFBox**
  - Images processed with **Tesseract OCR**
  - If OCR fails ‚Üí fallback to **OpenAI GPT-4 Vision**
  - Scientific or mathematical exams ‚Üí routed to **Nougat OCR** (LaTeX output)
- Advanced pre-processing:
  - Text cleaning and noise removal
  - Language detection (`es`, `en`, `fr`, `de`)
  - Exercise segmentation using multilingual patterns
- Results returned as `.pdf` or `.zip` based on format

## üß± Architecture

- **Microservices Overview**:

| Service                   | Description                                                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `exam-solver-gateway`     | API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)                          |
| `exam-solver-preprocessor`| Handles OCR, LaTeX, text cleanup and segmentation            |
| `exam-solver-nougat`      | Scientific OCR microservice using Facebook's Nougat         |
| `exam-solver-openai`      | Stateless service for OpenAI GPT API (Text & Vision)        |
| `exam-solver-integrator`  | Orchestrates retry logic, exam states and GPT processing    |
| `exam-solver-shared`      | Contains shared enums, DTOs, and JPA entities               |

- **Event-driven architecture** powered by **RabbitMQ**

- **Fallback detection** and **retry mechanism**:
  - State flow: `PENDING` ‚Üí `PROCESSING` ‚Üí `FROZEN` / `FAILED` / `COMPLETED`

- **NGINX** serves as reverse proxy and load balancer (multi-instance ready)

## üìå Design note on GPT-Vision usage

Currently, GPT-Vision is used **only as the last fallback** to directly solve or correct an exam when all other extraction methods fail (PDFBox, Tesseract OCR, Nougat, or noise heuristics).  
This choice prioritises delivery within a tight timeline, keeping the system functional and coherent while still showcasing advanced AI integration.

An **evolutionary design** (planned but not implemented yet) would separate the vision flow into:
1. Extracting text with GPT-Vision (`/vision/extract`), returning `{language, extractedText, confidence}`
2. Sending the extracted text to the preprocessor for cleaning and segmentation
3. Reusing the standard text processing pipeline for solving/correcting exercises

This approach would improve auditability, allow quality thresholds, and keep outputs more consistent. However, it involves additional orchestration steps and was deferred in order to prioritise the completion of the current stable version.
